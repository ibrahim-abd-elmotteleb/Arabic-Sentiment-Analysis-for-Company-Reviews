# Arabic Sentiment Analysis for Company Reviews

## Overview

This project implements a sentiment analysis model to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of Arabic company reviews, with a focus on platforms like Talabat. Using logistic regression, the model processes Arabic text to provide insights into customer opinions, helping businesses understand user feedback. The project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques tailored for Arabic, including morphological analysis and tokenization.

## Features

1) Sentiment classification of Arabic reviews using logistic regression.

2) Preprocessing of Arabic text with tools like qalsadi for morphological analysis.

3) Support for analyzing reviews from platforms like Talabat.

4) A user-friendly web interface built with Flask and Streamlit, allowing users to input Arabic reviews and view sentiment analysis results in real-time. 

5) Built with Python and popular NLP libraries for robust text processing.
